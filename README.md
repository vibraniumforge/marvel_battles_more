# README

This app uses Ruby version 2.3.6. It also uses Rails 5.2.2. It uses SQLite 3 to save data.

This app covers the Marvel Cinematic Universe of 20(!) films. It is difficult to keep track of what happened in each one. I made this app to help.

There is an account signup with name and password. Facebook may also be used to sign up.

A user logs in to the service and can then create characters, movies, and battles to categorize and save. I have seeded a lot of information, so make sure to rails db:seed before use.

To install, fork and clone the repo. Run "bundle" in the command line. Run "rake db:migrate" and "rake db:seed". Then, run "rails s" to start the server.

Create a new user account, and enjoy!

An existing account is user:a password: 1234.

To contribute please use the attached gitHub repo and functionality.
